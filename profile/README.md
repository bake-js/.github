# Bake

Welcome to **Bake**! This repository brings together a collection of open-source tools and frameworks designed to empower web developers in creating robust and high-performance interfaces. Created by [@deMGoncalves](https://github.com/deMGoncalves), **Bake** is the home of projects like **-O-id** and **-O-ego**, which focus on the efficient construction of Web Components.

Our focus is to simplify the development of high-performance web components by providing flexible and intuitive tools that facilitate the creation of modern and reactive interfaces.

## Projects

### -O-id

**-O-id** is a powerful library for developing custom Web Components. Inspired by the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud, the name "-O-id" symbolizes the primitive and essential foundation of every web component. The library is designed to be the foundation of high-performance interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable, highly efficient, and easy-to-maintain components.

With **-O-id**, you can take advantage of a series of decorators that facilitate the creation and lifecycle of components, making development smoother and less verbose. The simplicity and flexibility of **-O-id** make it ideal for those looking to create dynamic interfaces with complete control over reactivity and performance.

Learn more about **-O-id** [here](https://github.com/bake-js/-O-id).

### -O-ego

**-O-ego** is the natural extension of **-O-id** to the user interface layer. While **-O-id** represents the foundation of components, **-O-ego** is responsible for balancing form and function, delivering a smooth and highly performant visual experience. Inspired by the Freudian "ego," which balances impulses with reality, **-O-ego** acts as a bridge between the backend and the interface, ensuring that business logic translates into efficient visual components.

With **-O-ego**, developers have access to a library of ready-to-use UI Components that are fully customizable and optimized for performance. Whether creating responsive layouts or interactive components, **-O-ego** provides the necessary balance to build scalable and modern interfaces.
